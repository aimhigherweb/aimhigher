			<FAQ
				title="What is Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)?
				"
			>
				<p>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) affects how you show on Google searches & your position in those searches. SEO refers to this happening "organically", by "earning" your position in the results rather than using services such as Google AdWords to appear near the top.</p>
				<p>In general, the higher up the page you are, the more visitors you will receive to your site (when is the last time you clicked on a link on the second page of Google?).</p>
			</FAQ>
			<FAQ
				title="I want to manage the site myself, but I'm not great with technology..."
			>
				<p>Our focus is to make your life simple, and accessible. Many of our websites are built on WordPress which provides a friendly interface for any non-technical users. WordPress is the #1 CMS (Content Management System) used worldwide that makes up 35% of all the websites on the Internet.</p>
				<p>We value your autonomy at AimHigher, what we build <em>for you</em> is for you.</p>
			</FAQ>
			<FAQ
				title="How long does it take to get a website up and running?"
			>
				<p>This depends on the complexity of your site and how much you have to start with. On average, time to launch is two months from engagement.</p>
